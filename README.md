Required Functionality
The following required functionality is complete:

[yes] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
[yes] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
[yes] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.

[yes] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
[yes] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
[yes] User loses the game after an incorrect guess
The following optional features are implemented:

[ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
[ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
[ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
[ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
[ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
[ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
[ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)

Reflection Questions
If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
[I didn’t use any outside resources, but I used my prior knowledge from my introduction to computing class and the instructions provided in the pre-work instructions page.]

What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) [For this project, I struggled to understand some of the properties and syntax of the CSS language. This is because I have little experience with coding in CSS. For example, when I was analyzing what happens when a colored button is clicked, I didn’t understand the concept in the beginning. To overcome this confusion, I broke the code into smaller pieces and focused on one part of the code at a time. I also read the explanation provided on the pre-work instructions page for help, and tried to make the buttons active and inactive to see how the game changes. I found my knowledge of C++ and my experience in creating projects using that language useful. Although the Light and Sound project didn’t use C++, knowledge of concepts such as functions, global variables, and arrays were transferable to that project. ]

What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) [After completing this project, I am inspired to dive deeper into web development. I want to learn how to use web development languages to create apps and websites that help others work more efficiently. People often find it challenging to be productive because they struggle with organizing their tasks and goals. My goal is to create programs that aid students and professionals with managing their time, meetings, assignments and more. I am curious about how I can use web development to achieve my goals. ]

If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) [If I had more time to work on this project, I would spend that time adding additional features. I would allow the user to choose the level of difficulty they want to play. Before they start the game, the user would be asked to choose one level of difficulty out of three. If the highest level of difficulty is chosen, there would be six colored-buttons and the computer would play the sounds faster. If the intermediate level is selected, there would be five colored-buttons and the speed at which the buttons would be clicked would be moderate. If the easy level is chosen, there would be four colored-buttons and the speed would be slow like the original game. ]
